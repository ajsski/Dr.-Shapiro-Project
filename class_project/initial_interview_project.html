		</li>

	<dt>3. What is the big goal of the project?	</dt>
		<li>This book is over 10 years old. Client would like to:</li>
		<li>To republish the full text for free of the original book online </li>
		<li>To help drive sales for a revised version from a link to an online provider to purchase new material for the author.		</li>


	<dt>4. What are the basic components that will be required to solve the problem?</dt>	
		<li>Need a web server to host site.</li>
		<li>Need URL (not established yet).</li>
		<li>Creation of web pages to educate and promote for the client.</li>
		<li>Client has no working HTML knowledge.</li>

	<dt>5. What technologies will be used to solve the problem?	</dt>
		<li>Full stack- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/my SQL.</li>
		<li>Possibly a blog later down the road (WordPress) for the author to continue content to help draw more readers.</li>

	<dt>6. What is the time frame of the project?</dt>
		<li>October 13, 2021</li>
	
	<dt>7. What are the budget constraints or what resources are needed?</dt>
		<li>Budget for a real-life simulation, procure estimate on renting a web server, cloud service provider and track all billable hours-this could include designer and possibly project manager.</li>

	<dt>8. What are the major challenges of the project?</dt>
		<li>Author has no web authoring experience (HTML, Python, etc.) and no opportunity to self-manage the site. All content must be accurate before going live. No content edits by developer will occur once launched. Project must go through interview process, final proofing and approval by client before site content goes live. </li>

	<dt>9. Who are the key stakeholders/clients and members of the team?</dt>
		<li>Key Stakeholder of project is Dr. Robert Shapiro<br>
		Additional Stakeholders of project and their roles as follows:<br>
		Clinton Garwood – (client/boss) also key source for interview questions. Clint has a firm knowledge basis regarding Key Stakeholder-Dr. Shapiro’s needs and wants. Source for any questions. Site reviewer.<br>
		Self – (team development, coder and designer of team) Responsible for Analysis, Wire-framing, Mockup, Initial site specifications, Draft of Site, Internal testing/proofing. Final Site development and deployment.</li>

 
	<dt>10. Who is the target audience that the Key Stakeholder wants to reach? Is it more than just the potential purchasers of the updated publication, or is it the possibility of opening a bigger potential not originally discussed in preliminary interviews? There is open opportunity here when discussing putting children first in custody agreements, regardless of state.	</dt>
		<li>Adult audience. Couples separating, in dispute, divorce proceedings, family members and support networks. US market. Secondary language conversion possible in the future.</li>

	<dt>11. Does the Key Stakeholder want a way for the visitor of this site to reach out and ask questions directly to author by email request form?</dt>
		<li>Web form (doesn’t need to function specifically for this class project) contact us page, email address should be included.</li>

	<dt>12. Does the Key Stakeholder have any thought on what they would like their website to look and feel like? Are there any examples of webpages they like the look or feel of another site?	</dt>
		<li>Like a book. White pages black text.  No goth! No color text. Strictly educational. No style. Simple. Blue and Yellow approved for navigation and footer. Swedish flag. Current logo is broken house with cover on book and author. No imagery.</li>

	<dt>13. Does the Key Stakeholder want to be able to track traffic or statics from their site through a backstage tool or maybe an email alert? For example, an impression or how long they stayed on the page, or did they click on to go to possibly purchase the new book, etc? </dt>
