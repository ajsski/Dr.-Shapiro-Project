		<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dr Robert Shapiro – Ph.D. specializes in custody evaluations for couples going through divorce proceeding in Northern Illinois.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Separate Houses” written by Dr. Robert Shapiro Ph.D. is related to the topic of managing conflict resolution in situations of parental separation and divorce, specifically where decisions of child custody hang in the balance.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Separate Houses” was published nearly a decade ago, and the author wishes to share his work with a larger audience and has expressed interest in promoting the content of his book through a website interface.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The original version of the book is no longer in print. A copy has been obtained which provides the ability to extract (via OCR; Optical Character Recognition) the text from the book, with the hope of reformatting the text into ‘web-ready’ content. Client is interested in creating content to read as if you were turning book pages online. The author has full rights over the content, promotion and distribution of the book.</p>
