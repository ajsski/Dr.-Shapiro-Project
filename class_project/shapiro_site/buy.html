				<h3>Customer Reviews:</h3>
				<p class="copy_reviews">Such a great read. its hard to navigate through divorce, and when you add in custody discussion, it gets harder. Divorce affects everyone.<br>Mike T.</p>
				<p class="copy_reviews">You won't find these elsewhere (at least that I know of). There is the "Divorce Destructiveness Scale" which will help parents assess how they're handling the divorce in relationship to their children and the "Custody Determination Test" that can be used as a loose guide (along with other factors) in making a parenting plan that works. <br>Leslie D.</p>
	  			<p class="copy_reviews">Separate Houses stands out as a helpful book. it's easy to read and the advice on divorce and stepfamily situations are helpful. There is the "Divorce Destructiveness Scale" which will help parents assess how they're handling the divorce in relationship to their children. Just 90 pgs. long, the book packs a lot in. <br>Shara M.</p>
